	abstract = {The anticipated applications of quantum computers span across science and industry, ranging from quantum chemistry and many-body physics to optimization, finance, and machine learning. Proposed quantum solutions in these areas typically combine multiple quantum algorithmic primitives into an overall quantum algorithm, which must then incorporate the methods of quantum error correction and fault tolerance to be implemented correctly on quantum hardware. As such, it can be difficult to assess how much a particular application benefits from quantum computing, as the various approaches are often sensitive to intricate technical details about the underlying primitives and their complexities. Here we present a survey of several potential application areas of quantum algorithms and their underlying algorithmic primitives, carefully considering technical caveats and subtleties. We outline the challenges and opportunities in each area in an "end-to-end" fashion by clearly defining the problem being solved alongside the input-output model, instantiating all "oracles," and spelling out all hidden costs. We also compare quantum solutions against state-of-the-art classical methods and complexity-theoretic limitations to evaluate possible quantum speedups. The survey is written in a modular, wiki-like fashion to facilitate navigation of the content. Each primitive and application area is discussed in a standalone section, with its own bibliography of references and embedded hyperlinks that direct to other relevant sections. This structure mirrors that of complex quantum algorithms that involve several layers of abstraction, and it enables rapid evaluation of how end-to-end complexities are impacted when subroutines are altered.},

Not only are they crucial to the programming of quantum computers at scale but also they can facilitate the discovery and development of quantum algorithms even before hardware exists that is capable of executing them. Quantum programming languages are used for controlling existing physical devices, for estimating the execution costs of quantum algorithms on future devices, for teaching quantum computing concepts, or for verifying quantum algorithms and their implementations. They are used by newcomers and seasoned practitioners, researchers and developers working on the next ground-breaking discovery or applying known concepts to real-world problems. This variety in purpose and target audiences is reflected in the design and ecosystem of the existing quantum programming languages, depending on which factors a language prioritizes. In this Review, we highlight important aspects of quantum programming and how it differs from conventional programming. We overview a selection of several state-of-the-art quantum programming languages, highlight their salient features, and provide code samples for each of the languages and Docker files to facilitate installation of the software packages.},

Interest has since been growing in the area of quantum computation. One of the main difficulties of quantum computation is that decoherence destroys the information in a superposition of states contained in a quantum computer, thus making long computations impossible. It is shown how to reduce the effects of decoherence for information stored in quantum memory, assuming that the decoherence process acts independently on each of the bits stored in memory. This involves the use of a quantum analog of errorcorrecting codes., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {Distributed quantum networks will allow users to perform tasks and to interact in ways which are not possible with present-day technology. Their implementation is a key challenge for quantum science and requires the development of stationary quantum nodes that can send and receive as well as store and process quantum information locally. The nodes are connected by quantum channels for flying information carriers, i.e., photons. These channels serve both to directly exchange quantum information between nodes and to distribute entanglement over the whole network. In order to scale such networks to many particles and long distances, an efficient interface between the nodes and the channels is required. This article describes the cavity-based approach to this goal, with an emphasis on experimental systems in which single atoms are trapped in and coupled to optical resonators. Besides being conceptually appealing, this approach is promising for quantum networks on larger scales, as it gives access to long qubit coherence times and high light-matter coupling efficiencies. Thus, it allows one to generate entangled photons on the push of a button, to reversibly map the quantum state of a photon onto an atom, to transfer and teleport quantum states between remote atoms, to entangle distant atoms, to detect optical photons nondestructively, to perform entangling quantum gates between an atom and one or several photons, and even provides a route toward efficient heralded quantum memories for future repeaters. The presented general protocols and the identification of key parameters are applicable to other experimental systems.},

	abstract = {Entanglement between quantum network nodes is often produced using intermediary devices - such as heralding stations - as a resource. When scaling quantum networks to many nodes, requiring a dedicated intermediary device for every pair of nodes introduces high costs. Here, we propose a cost-effective architecture to connect many quantum network nodes via a central quantum network hub called an Entanglement Generation Switch ({EGS}). The {EGS} allows multiple quantum nodes to be connected at a fixed resource cost, by sharing the resources needed to make entanglement. We propose an algorithm called the Rate Control Protocol ({RCP}) which moderates the level of competition for access to the hub's resources between sets of users. We proceed to prove a convergence theorem for rates yielded by the algorithm. To derive the algorithm we work in the framework of Network Utility Maximization ({NUM}) and make use of the theory of Lagrange multipliers and Lagrangian duality. Our {EGS} architecture lays the groundwork for developing control architectures compatible with other types of quantum network hubs as well as system models of greater complexity.},

	isbn = {978-0-12-745040-7},
	abstract = {These proceedings of the {ACM} {SIGPLAN} History of Programming Languages ({HOPL}) conference are a record, in the words of those who helped make the history, of a baker's dozen of the languages that set the tone of most of today's programming. It is difficult to describe the feeling that prevailed at the conference. There were no parallel sessions. Some attendees were graduate students, some pioneers, many were practitioners, and there seemed roughly an even division between industrial and academic affiliation. It was the first conference I attended where virtually everyone attended every session.The Conference General Chairman's introduction (page xvii) provides a rationale for the languages chosen and what the speakers were asked to prepare. There was an official Conference Historian. (How can you have a "History of . . ." conference without a historian?) His introduction (page xxi) attempts to present the conference in the perspective of modern history-of-science scholarship.The Keynote Address (page 7) was given by Grace Murray Hopper, Captain, {USN}, who was present at the birth of the industry and has remained an active participant. Her remarks indicate that a lot of what is considered novel and innovative today may well have first been done by her Remington-Rand Univac crew back in the 1950s.The largest part of this volume is taken up with the languages themselves, in chapters each assembled in the following way:The formal paper from the preprints (with some modifications by the authors).A transcript of the formal conference presentation.A transcript of the discussant's presentation. (There were discussants for {APL}, {COBOL}, {FORTRAN}, {LISP}, {PL}/I, and {SIMULA} only.)A transcript of the question and answer session.The full text of questions submitted in writing by the attendees (some with additional answers provided by the author).Authors' biographies.Summaries of the languages appear in Appendix A.The order of the languages in this book is the order of the talks given at the conference. With the exception of {JOSS}, the formal papers were published as preprints in {ACM} {SIGPLAN} Notices, Vol. 13, No. 8 (August 1978). The papers are reprinted here with the permission of {ACM} and of the authors. In some cases, changes to the preprints have been made by the authors to correct typographical or factual errors. In a few cases, additional material was added.For {ALGOL}, two speakers were chosen initially to reflect the European and American points of view. An additional "short note" from another {ALGOL} pioneer has also been included.The section on {JOSS} has a slightly different format since, due to a change in planned speaker, no paper for {JOSS} appeared in the preprints. To provide a broad historical outlook, the speaker was requested to make major revisions, expanding his talk into a formal paper.No two speakers are alike and the transcripts of the talks reflect the differences. Some tended to repeat in the oral presentation the material in the formal preprint; others gave almost completely independent talks. In editing the transcripts, no attempt was made to remove redundancy. As far as possible, all that was said is included here. Editing has removed false starts and hesitations; punctuation has been added to try to clarify involved, run-on sentences. Interpolations are, for the most part, enclosed in brackets. Most sessions began and ended with administrative announcements which are omitted here.Some of the talks were followed by formal presentations by discussants, and the transcripts of these are presented with the same type of editing as was used with the talks.The question and answer sessions were handled at the conference by having written questions submitted to the session chairman during the talk. The chairman selected some of them to ask the speaker; the editing of the speakers' replies is similar to that indicated above.The full text of all questions submitted is included and, in several cases, the authors have annotated this list, either keying the questions to the place in the transcript or the paper where it is answered or answering a question not covered at the conference.Authors were asked to provide a brief biography highlighting their activities before the time period covered by the paper and their more recent work. For the most part, the biographies are the author's own words. In a few cases, the editor had to create a narrative biography from a terse curriculum vitae. If editorial license was carried too far in any case, my apologies. The pictures that accompany the biographies are Candid photographs taken during the conference, and the subjects did not have a chance to select which pictures they preferred.The after-dinner speeches at the conference banquet were devoted to humorous reminiscences and anecdotes about the languages and events during their development. The banquet anecdotes are not included in this volume because, although they are humorous to hear, the voice inflections make a big difference, and they are not necessarily amusing to read.Audio and video tapes of the entire conference are available from {ACM} Headquarters: 1133 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036.},
