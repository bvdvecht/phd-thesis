  \item Existing full-stack models for classical computing and networking seduce scientists into trying to apply similar models to quantum computing and networking prematurely.
  \item For increasing quantum network application performance (such as success probability), improving scheduling is far more effective than improving compilation.
  
  % not thesis-related
  \item Program code supporting scientific work should undergo the same scrutiny as the manuscript text when evaluating publication.
  \item Researchers should be encouraged to improve their papers using large language models such as ChatGPT.
  \item Whether a result `advances science' depends not on some objective standard, but rather the scientist's skill in convincing the reader that their work is non-trivial.
  \item The proposal that science may at some point provide a `theory of everything' is naive at best and harmful for humankind at worst.
  \item When proposing a new paradigm, scientific evaluation in the form of `it works' is sufficient.
  \item A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) should have a thorough grasp of philosophy in order to be worthy of their title.
  \item Treating life as a project severely lowers its quality.
  \item Traffic lights are configured in such a way that at an intersection, at any point in time, there is at least one vehicle waiting at a red light.
