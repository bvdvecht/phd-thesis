\begin{enumerate}[widest=10]
  \item Having existing software abstraction in the classical world seduces us in trying to apply full-stack model to quantum computing prematurely.

  \item Quantum computing development speed will be limited severely as long as one does not provide a solution to the problem whether a qubit refers to a value or a memory location.

  \item The quantum internet is a solution looking for problems.

  \item The name of a tool or algorithm is more important than the thing it does.

  \item A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) should have a thorough grasp of philosophy in order to be worth the title.

  \item It should be fine to write and edit papers with LLMs like ChatGPT.

  \item There should be no more page limits on papers since LLMs can summarize them for you.

  \item An applied scientist is just an engineer using big words.

  \item At a traffic intersection, there always needs to be at least one waiting vehicle.

  \item Program code written for scientific publication should undergo the same scrutiny as the manuscript text.

  \item Science should remain in balance with engineering otherwise it risks losing touch with what is really needed.

  \item Scientific breakthroughs are merely re-orderings of existing knowledge but where the reader is convinced of its non-triviality.
