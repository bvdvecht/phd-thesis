  \item The quantum internet is a solution looking for problems.

  \item The name of a tool or algorithm is more important than the thing it does.

  \item There should be no more page limits on papers since LLMs can summarize them for you.

  \item An applied scientist is just an engineer using big words.
  % vague line between engineering and science


  \item Science should remain in balance with engineering otherwise it risks losing touch with what is really needed.

  \item Having an opinion about everything either shows an overconfidence or a waste of energy.

  \item When designing a new paradigm, evaluation is a wild west or free-for-all.
  % if you make something for the first time (a new thing/paradigm) and there is nothing to compare it to,
  %       then its evaluation can be anything and is often not interesting (just "it works" or use arbitrary metrics)

  % Wisdom as opposed to just knowledge/better tech
  % Working hours, 4 day work week, burnout, stress
  % Iets met religie/spiritualiteit
  % neoliberalisme: everything is a competition and market; you even have to sell/promote yourself 
  % 4-year PhD is not science; it's an engineering project due to limited time in which you have to forcefully produce "output" (no time to do proper science)
  % finiteness of life, limitations
  % latex shouldn't be used anymore, it's ancient

  % STRONG (still to be re-formulated)
  % thesis-related
  \item Quantum computing development speed will be limited severely as long as one does not provide a solution to the problem whether a qubit refers to a value or a memory location.
  \item Having existing software abstraction in the classical world seduces us in trying to apply full-stack model to quantum computing prematurely.
  
  % not thesis-related
  \item At traffic intersections, the lights are always such that at any point in time, there is at least one waiting vehicle.
  \item Program code written for scientific publication should undergo the same scrutiny as the manuscript text.
  \item It should be fine, even encouraged, to write and edit papers with LLMs like ChatGPT.
  \item A Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) should have a thorough grasp of philosophy in order to be worth the title.
  \item The validity of scientific `breakthroughs' depends not on some objective standard, but rather the author's skill in tricking the reader in believing it is non-trivial.
  % triviality is subjective. for one person something might be interesting/new enough, but for the other just a
