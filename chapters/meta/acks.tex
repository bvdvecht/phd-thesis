\todo{To complete for final version, after committee feedback.}

This thesis is the result of more than four years of research and development, and would not have been possible without the help of many people.

First of all, many thanks to my promotor \textbf{Stephanie}.
Our start may have been a bit unorthodox; when I started, not only were you on maternity leave, but we were in a global lockdown as well.
It maybe took some time to get in a good collaboration, but I enjoyed the balance between giving me freedom and responsibility as well as giving very valuable feedback and guidance when needed.
I admire your ability to keep up many balls (although I'm not jealous of your busy calendar) and for being supportive when I was having doubts about continuing the PhD.
Although I've always felt a software engineer or architect that has to sell himself as a scientist, you convinced me that after all I am a scientist and that my work is good enough to pass off as academic results.

I would also like to thank my committee members:
\textbf{Arie van Deursen}, acting as second promotor;
\textbf{Rob Kooij}, who was so kind to agree to be in the committee after 9 other TU Delft full professors declined the invitation;
\textbf{Rodney van Meter}, coming all the way from Japan;
\textbf{Michele Amoretti}, who has been a nice QIA colleague;
\textbf{Tim Coopmans}, who was a fellow PhD student at QuTech when I started and it's great to see him in this new role;
\textbf{Koen Langendoen}, for being so kind to be available as a reserve member.

My paranymphs, \textbf{Francisco} and \textbf{Carlo}.
Carlo, you have been a great office mate. Always calm and very interested, extremely kind. Your plants are still going strong!
Francisco, you've been the most consistent in being in the office. You were always a center point of the group.


I've been lucky to have been part of a diverse group of people.
- fellow researchers
    - including QIA, non-delft
- software engineers
- band members


I want to give thanks to my research group.
Over the years there have been many people, all of which have made an impact on me.
Some of you I've mostly seen online, during lockdown.
Others have only joined recently and I'm proud to say you'll be continuing parts of my work.


% The start of my PhD has been strange.
% My first day was during the first major covid lockdown, online, and it turned out that almost the first 2 years of my PhD were mostly from home, seeing my colleagues only in Teams video calls.
% After this, it took some time for me to get used to `this' being how a PhD is supposed to be: seeing your colleagues in real life and have social interactions with them.

Even with the strange start, I had a great mentor and person who onboarded me: \textbf{Axel}.
You are a coding legend, using vim and Arch Linux and who knows how many custom tools.

Aram, your time at QuTech was unfortunately short. Still, I remember your kindness and I enjoyed multiple of your Iranian selfmade sweets.
Matt (Skrzypczyk), I saw you mostly online. Hope that you're doing great wherever you've ended up!
Guus, you were a real scientist. I enjoyed the board games you organized.
David, you were always laughing and having fun, and kudos for you to switch from a PhD since it was not fun.

Tim, Kenneth, Sebastian, Siddanth, Fenglei, thanks for being great members in David's "sattelite group".
Luise, Matt (Steinberg), and others from Sebastian Feld's group, thanks for an amazing time at QCE 23 in Seattle.

% This leads to other people that I've mostly interacted with online.
% However, we had some great activities together like hanging out in the grass or going for walks.

Ravi, I enjoyed your office presence as well. I liked our more software related discussions, and I'm happy that you found a role in QuTech that really fits you.




Alvaro, you're like really chill, and you play badminton very well. 
Bethany, that also holds for you!

Scarlett, I admire your strategy of doing your own thing.

Janice, you're a people person and really socially carry the group.

Jeroen, let's talk more about philosophy!

Soubhadra, thanks for organizing all the group visits!

Luca, it is a pleasure to have you as an office mate. Also you have a bright PhD ahead of you.

Margrete, it is nice to hear someone *liking* dutch weather since at least it's not as cold and dark as Norway.

Sam, you just started but are already blasting off. I expect great things from you.
I hope my elaborate simulator implementation is managable.

Sacha, 
Felix,

Thomas, I remember you getting into the content really quickly when you joined your PhD. Your drive and interest in network scheduling will go a long way!

Kaushik, Sounak, it was nice to have you as office mates.

Special thanks to \textbf{Mariagrazia}, I really enjoyed our time doing the QNodeOS experiments. We did a great job staying calm and we achieved a big result! Our work made me realize that my work actually is good for something, running on real hardware.
Carmina, thanks for hosting me in Valencia. I had a great time with you and Anabel.

\textbf{Bob}, you can be proud of your master thesis. You really helped kickstart the Qoala project.
\textbf{Hana}, you've been with our group pretty much since ever. I enjoyed supervising you; honestly you were so good it was easy for me.
So you also provided great insight into Qoala.
\textbf{Atak}, you kind of appeared out of nowhere as an intern in the summer of 2023. It was a pleasure working with you and you contributed greatly to the Qoala simulator. I was impressed with your skills while still being a bachelor student.

\textbf{Wojciech}, I first met you in fall 2019 at a hackathon. Thanks for nagging Stephanie to look at my PhD application! You've always inspired me since you're insanely smart, organized and level headed.



STACK TEAM

\textbf{Ingmar}, you're a great software engineer and can be proud of the teams you've built, like the stack team!
Speaking of stack team, \textbf{Guilherme}, you were kind and I like your C++ blogs!
\textbf{Thom}, you're a great addition to the Stack team.

Michal, thanks for taking over the squidasm development! It's in very capable hands.
It's nice to have you in the office.

Mark, I enjoyed working with you on QNE. Thanks also for support by Fer, Olaf, Ivo, and many other software engineers that have helped with QNE.

Other software engineers: \textbf{Ravi}, thanks for hanging out in Leuven.



Q2 band: I couldn't go without anymore. Thanks for the great rehearsals every Wednesday and all the awesome performances that we did. You're all insanely talented.
