This thesis is the result of more than four years of research and development, and would not have been possible without the help of many people.

First of all, many thanks to my promotor \textbf{Stephanie}.
I admire your ability to keep up many balls (although I'm not jealous of your busy calendar) and for being supportive when I was considering quitting the phd.
I've always felt a software engineer or architect that has to sell himself as a scientist.
Thank you for motivating me that after all I am a scientist and that my work is good enough to pass off as academic results.

I would also like to thank my committee members: \todo{including Arie}.

Axel, thank you for onboarding me. It was a strange time, during the first lockdown in 2020. Even though we had to do everything though video calls, you included me in the group and brought me up to speed with the work. You were a coding legend, using vim and Arch Linux and who knows how many custom tools.

This leads to other people that I've mostly interacted with online.
However, we had some great activities together like hanging out in the grass or going for walks.

Carlo, you have been a great office mate. Always calm and very interested, extremely kind. Your plants are still going strong!

Ravi, I enjoyed your office presence as well. I liked our more software related discussions, and I'm happy that you found a role in QuTech that really firs you.

Aram, your time at QuTech was unfortunately short. Still, I remember your kindness and I enjoyed multiple of your Iranian selfmade sweets.

Matt, I saw you mostly online. Hope that you're doing great wherever you've ended up!

Michal, thanks for taking over the squidasm development! It's in very capable hands.

Guus, you were a real scientist. I enjoyed the board games you organized.

David, you were always laughing and having fun, and kudos for you to switch from a PhD since it was not fun.

Francisco, you've been the most consistent in being in the office. You were always a center point of the group.

Alvaro, you're like really chill, and you play badminton very well. 

Bethany, that also holds for you!

Scarlett, I admire your strategy of doing your own thing.

Janice, you're a people person and really socially carry the group.

Jeroen, let's talk more about philosophy!

Soubhadra, thanks for organizing all the group visits!

Luca, it was a pleasure to have you as an office mate. Also you have a bright PhD ahead of you.

Margrete, it is nice to hear someone *liking* dutch weather since at least it's not as cold as Norway.

Sam, you just started but are already blasting off. I expect great things from you.

Thomas, I remember you getting into the content really quickly when you joined your PhD. Your drive and interest in network scheduling will go a long way!

Tzula, you have a great voice.

Kaushik, Sounak, it was nice to have you as office mates.

Bob, you can be proud of your master thesis.

Hana, you've been with our group pretty much since ever. I enjoyed supervising you; honestly you were so good it was easy for me.

Atak, you kind of appeared out of nowhere as an intern in the summer of 2023. It was a pleasure working with you and you contributed greatly to the Qoala simulator. I was impressed with your skills while still being a bachelor student.

Wojtek, I first met you in fall 2019 at a hackathon. Thanks for nagging Stephanie to look at my PhD application! You've always inspired me since you're insanely smart, organized and level headed.

Ingmar, you're a great software engineer and can be proud of the teams you've built!

Mark, same for you. I enjoyed working with you on QNE. Thanks also for support by Fer, Olaf, Ivo, and many other software engineers that have helped with QNE.

Tim, Kenneth, Sebastian, Siddanth, Fenglei, thanks for being great members in David's "sattelite group".

Luise, Matt, and others from Sebastian Feld's group, thanks for an amazing time at QCE 23 in Seattle.

Gayane, be proud of your group.

Guilherme, you were kind and I like your C++ blogs!

Thom, you're a great addition to the Stack team.

Mariagrazia, I really enjoyed our time doing the QNodeOS experiments. We did a great job staying calm and we achieved a big result! Our work made me realize that my work actually is good for something, running on real hardware.

Carmina, thanks for hosting me in Valencia. I had a great time with you and Anabel.

Q2 band: I couldn't go without anymore. Thanks for the great rehearsals every Wednesday and all the awesome performances that we did. You're all insanely talented.
