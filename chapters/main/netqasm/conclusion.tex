\section{Conclusion}
\label{netqasm:sec:conclusion}
\ac{NetQASM} enables the development of quantum internet applications in a platform-independent manner.
It solves the question of dealing with the complexity of having both classical and quantum operations in a single program, while at the same time providing a relatively simple format for \ac{QNPU}-like layers to handle.
Multiple applications, such as remote teleportation and blind quantum computation, have already been implemented.
A simple compiler has been implemented that can translate code written in the higher-level SDK into \ac{NetQASM}.
