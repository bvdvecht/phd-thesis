 {Compiling Qoala programs}
\label{chp:compiler}


\begin{abstract}
In this chapter, we discuss the problem of compiling quantum network programs.
We review what we want compilers to do for quantum network applications and discuss related work.
We then discuss design consideration for a compiler for Qoala programs.
We give recommendations on the design of such a compiler and conclude with pointers for further research and evaluation.
