 {Compiling Qoala programs}
\label{chp:compiler}


\begin{abstract}
In this chapter, we discuss the problem of compiling quantum network programs.
First, we review what compilers are and what we want them to do for quantum network applications.
Then, we discuss challenges specific to compiling for such applications and discuss related work.
We give recommendations on the design of such a compiler and conclude with pointers for further research and evaluation.
