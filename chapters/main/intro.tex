\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:intro}

This work shows a history of projects that build upon each other.
The work has been part of a larger ecosystem in which multiple projects worked towards the goal of executing quantum network applications.
Many software packages have been written.

The original goal of this PhD project was to research compilation of quantum network programs.
It turned out that first many other things needed to be fleshed out.
This thesis can be seen as following the road towards fleshing this out, culminating in a chapter with ideas on compilation.
